TestTrack is an open-source split-testing and feature-toggling system written in Ruby on Rails.

### Key features and design decisions

* Uses a stateful server to provide consistent experiences for customers across devices, and allow for bulk assignment overrides.
* Rich client libraries available for multiple platforms optimized to minimize time-to-glass and gracefully degrade if the server is unavailable.
* Designed to streamline developer and PM workflow - focusing on designing and running your tests, not the plumbing, and reducing incidence of implementation mistakes that can hurt your data.
* Provides an optional Chrome extension to allow your team to interactively override their split assignments.
* TestTrack is not an analysis tool. It focuses on fast, trustworthy, and robust split assignment and identity management, leaving analysis to the great tools that already exist, and those that are yet to come.

Check out [the Rails at Scale talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRGSwzUrCCo) for some background on why we built it and some of the key design decisions behind TestTrack:

[![Rails @ Scale Talk](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mRGSwzUrCCo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRGSwzUrCCo)

The TestTrack system consists of the following components:

* the server (this repository)
* the [Rails client](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_rails_client)
* the [JS client](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_js_client)
* the [Chrome extension](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_chrome_extension)

## Getting Started

### Requirements
The list of requirements to configure a TestTrack server are:
  * Ruby 2.2.3+
  * Postgresql 9.4+

### Installation

#### Option 1: Deploy to heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### Option 2: Deploy to your machine:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Betterment/test_track`
1. `bundle install`
1. `bundle exec rake db:setup`
1. `bundle exec rails server`

#### Either way:

At this point, you've got a working installation and can proceed to setting up the [Rails client](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_rails_client) in order to create your first split.

### Deployment
TestTrack is designed to deploy as a conventional [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) application.

Required environment variables:
* `DATABASE_URL` -- the url to your Postgresql database server

#### Configuration for JS Client
In order to use the JS client, you will need to specify the set of hosts that will be making CORS requests to your TestTrack server. That can be set via the `WHITELIST_CORS_HOSTS` environment variable.

```bash
export WHITELIST_CORS_HOSTS=yoursite.example.org,othersite.example.org
```

#### Configuration for Chrome extension
In order to use the TestTrack Chrome extension, you will need to set up the `BROWSER_EXTENSION_SHARED_SECRET` environment variable. [Details.](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_chrome_extension#building-the-extension)

## Managing your installation
There are a few things that you will need to do in the TestTrack application:
* Create `App`s -- client applications that will manage splits on your TestTrack server
* Create `Admin`s -- users that can access the admin features of the TestTrack server
* Manage splits using the admin features

### Creating Apps
In order to create spilts in your client applications, you will need to register that client application with your TestTrack server. Run the following in a rails console.

```ruby
> App.create!(name: "[myapp]", auth_secret: SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(32)).auth_secret
=> "[your new app password]"
```

This is the password that you should plug into your client application's `TEST_TRACK_API_URL`.

#### Seeding Apps For Local Development
At Betterment, we run TestTrack in every environment, including our
laptops, which enables engineers to override splits with the Chrome
extension while they code.

TestTrack provides a Rake task to make it easier to set up apps that
automatically get reloaded whenever you recreate your TestTrack
database. If you want to add a rails app called `widget_maker` to
TestTrack, run:

```shell
rake seed_app[widget_maker]
```

This will do three things:
* Find or create a file called `db/seed_apps.yml`
* Find or create an entry in it for your app name and set a randomly
  generated `auth_secret`
* Run `rake db:seed`, which reloads your seed apps into the database

Note that `db/seed_apps.yml` is `.gitignore`d so you can run TestTrack
locally without having a private copy of the `test_track` repository or
having uncommitted changes on your local checkout. That way it's easier
to contribute to TestTrack, and stay on the latest version of the open
source product.

You can use a configuration management tool like
[boxen](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen) to install TestTrack and
inject a custom `seed_apps.yml` file for your team.

### Creating Admins
In order to access the admin features of the TestTrack server, you must create an `Admin` in your database. Run the following in a rails console.

```ruby
> Admin.create!(email: "myemail@example.org", password: "[something secret]")
```

### Enabling attachments
Variants can be associated with metadata to describe their effects in human-readable terms. To enable variant screenshots, you'll need some additional configuration in environment variables.

- To store uploads on the local file system, set `ATTACHMENT_STORAGE` to `local`, and:
  - `LOCAL_UPLOAD_PATH` (optional, defaults to `:rails_root/public/system/:class/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:filename`)
- To store uploads in S3, set `ATTACHMENT_STORAGE` to `s3`, and:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (required)
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (required)
  - `AWS_REGION` (optional, defaults to us-east-1)
  - `S3_ATTACHMENT_BUCKET` (required)
  - `S3_ATTACHMENT_PERMISSIONS` (optional, defaults to `private`; see [AWS canned ACLs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl))
  - `S3_ATTACHMENT_PATH` (optional, defaults to `:class/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:filename`)

## Concepts

### App
A Rails application that manages Splits on the TestTrack server.

### Admin
A member of your team that administers the weightings of splits, deciding a the winning variant of a split, and uploading one-off visitor assignments.

### Visitor
A person using your application.

### Split
A feature for which TestTrack will be assigning different behavior for different visitors.

Split names must be strings and should be expressed in `snake_case`. E.g. `homepage_redesign_late_2015_experiment`, `signup_button_color_experiment`, or `invite_button_enabled`.

### Variant
One the values that a given visitor will be assigned for a split, e.g. `true` or `false` for a classic A/B test or e.g. `red`, `blue`, and `green` for a multi-way split.  Variants may be strings or booleans, and they should be expressed in `snake_case`.

### Weighting
Variants are assigned pseudo-randomly to visitors based on their visitor IDs and the weightings for the variants.  Weightings describe the probability of a visitor being assigned to a given variant in integer percentages.  All the variant weightings for a given split must sum to 100, though variants may have a weighting of 0.

### Experiment

Experiments are the standard flavor of splits in TestTrack. They are
intended to be used for A/B testing, and the TestTrack server records
visitors' experienced variants so that those visitors will continue to
experience the same variant regardless of subsequent changes to the
weightings of those variants via the admin interface.

Storing the variant a visitor experienced for an experiment also allows
TestTrack to provide a consistent UX to a customer who experienced a
new-to-them experiment before logging in on a new device, only to be
recognized as an existing visitor upon sign-in.  TestTrack will merge
all variant assignments from the anonymous visitor into the
authenticated visitor at sign-in as long as the authenticated visitor
doesn't have conflicting assignments.  In that case, the authenticated
visitor's previous assignments win.

### Feature Gate

As of TestTrack version 1.2, splits with names ending in the `_enabled`
suffix will be treated as feature gates. Feature gates differ from
experiments in that they are not intended to be used for analysis, and
therefore it is not important that the user remain in the same variant
throughout the entire split lifecycle. Feature gates are meant to be
slow-rolled (incrementally increasing the percentage of customers
experiencing the new feature), released en masse, or instantly rolled
back.

To facilitate these smooth transitions and rapid toggles, the TestTrack
server will not record variant assignments when a visitor experiences a
split. This means that every time a visitor experiences a split, they
will be deterministically (pseudorandomly) assigned to a variant based
on their visitor ID and the name of the split. This will provide the
customer with a stable variant given a constant split weighting, but
probablistically increase the percentage of visitors experiencing the
the `true` variant as the split weightings are increased via the admin
panel, giving an admin full control over the feature's release.

### IdentifierType
A name for a customer identifier that is meaningful in your application, typically things that people sign up as, log in as.  They should be expressed in `snake_case` and conventionally are prefixed with the application name that the identifier is for, e.g. `myapp_user_id`, `myapp_lead_id`.
