# TestTrack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Betterment/test_track.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Betterment/test_track)

TestTrack is an open-source split-testing and feature-toggling system written in Ruby on Rails.

### Key features and design decisions

* Uses a stateful server to provide consistent experiences for customers across devices, and allow for bulk assignment overrides.
* Rich client libraries available for multiple platforms optimized to minimize time-to-glass and gracefully degrade if the server is unavailable.
* Designed to streamline developer and PM workflow - focusing on designing and running your tests, not the plumbing, and reducing incidence of implementation mistakes that can hurt your data.
* Provides an optional Chrome extension to allow your team to interactively override their split assignments.
* TestTrack is not an analysis tool. It focuses on fast, trustworthy, and robust split assignment and identity management, leaving analysis to the great tools that already exist, and those that are yet to come.

Check out [the Rails at Scale talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRGSwzUrCCo) for some background on why we built it and some of the key design decisions behind TestTrack:

[![Rails @ Scale Talk](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mRGSwzUrCCo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRGSwzUrCCo)

The TestTrack system consists of the following components:

* the server (this repository)
* the [Rails client](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_rails_client)
* the [JS client](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_js_client)
* the [Chrome extension](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_chrome_extension)

## Getting Started

### Requirements
The list of requirements to configure a TestTrack server are:
  * Ruby 2.2.3+
  * Postgresql 9.4+

### Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/Betterment/test_track`
1. `bundle install`
1. `bundle exec rake db:setup`
1. `bundle exec rails server`

At this point, you've got a working installation and can proceed to setting up the [Rails client](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_rails_client) in order to create your first split.

### Deployment
TestTrack is designed to deploy as a conventional [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) application.

Required environment variables:
* `DATABASE_URL` -- the url to your Postgresql database server

#### Configuration for JS Client
In order to use the JS client, you will need to specify the set of hosts that will be making CORS requests to your TestTrack server. That can be set via the `WHITELIST_CORS_HOSTS` environment variable.

```bash
export WHITELIST_CORS_HOSTS=yoursite.example.org,othersite.example.org
```

#### Configuration for Chrome extension
In order to use the TestTrack Chrome extension, you will need to set up the `BROWSER_EXTENSION_SHARED_SECRET` environment variable. [Details.](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track_chrome_extension#building-the-extension)

## Managing your installation
There are a few things that you will need to do in the TestTrack application:
* Create `App`s -- client applications that will manage splits on your TestTrack server
* Create `Admin`s -- users that can access the admin features of the TestTrack server
* Manage splits using the admin features

### Creating Apps
In order to create spilts in your client applications, you will need to register that client application with your TestTrack server. Run the following in a rails console.

```ruby
> App.create!(name: "[myapp]", auth_secret: SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(32)).auth_secret
=> "[your new app password]"
```

This is the password that you should plug into your client application's `TEST_TRACK_API_URL`.

#### Seeding Apps For Local Development
At Betterment, we run TestTrack in every environment, including our
laptops, which enables engineers to override splits with the Chrome
extension while they code.

TestTrack provides a Rake task to make it easier to set up apps that
automatically get reloaded whenever you recreate your TestTrack
database. If you want to add a rails app called `widget_maker` to
TestTrack, run:

```shell
rake seed_app[widget_maker]
```

This will do three things:
* Find or create a file called `db/seed_apps.yml`
* Find or create an entry in it for your app name and set a randomly
  generated `auth_secret`
* Run `rake db:seed`, which reloads your seed apps into the database

Note that `db/seed_apps.yml` is `.gitignore`d so you can run TestTrack
locally without having a private copy of the `test_track` repository or
having uncommitted changes on your local checkout. That way it's easier
to contribute to TestTrack, and stay on the latest version of the open
source product.

You can use a configuration management tool like
[boxen](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen) to install TestTrack and
inject a custom `seed_apps.yml` file for your team.

### Creating Admins
In order to access the admin features of the TestTrack server, you must create an `Admin` in your database. Run the following in a rails console.

```ruby
> Admin.create!(email: "myemail@example.org", password: "[something secret]")
```

## Concepts

### App
A Rails application that manages Splits on the TestTrack server.

### Admin
A member of your team that administers the weightings of splits, deciding a the winning variant of a split, and uploading one-off visitor assignments.

### Visitor
A person using your application.

### Split
A feature for which TestTrack will be assigning different behavior for different visitors.

Split names must be strings and should be expressed in `snake_case`. E.g. `homepage_redesign_late_2015_experiment`, `signup_button_color_experiment`, or `invite_button_enabled`.

### Variant
One the values that a given visitor will be assigned for a split, e.g. `true` or `false` for a classic A/B test or e.g. `red`, `blue`, and `green` for a multi-way split.  Variants may be strings or booleans, and they should be expressed in `snake_case`.

### Weighting
Variants are assigned pseudo-randomly to visitors based on their visitor IDs and the weightings for the variants.  Weightings describe the probability of a visitor being assigned to a given variant in integer percentages.  All the variant weightings for a given split must sum to 100, though variants may have a weighting of 0.

### IdentifierType
A name for a customer identifier that is meaningful in your application, typically things that people sign up as, log in as.  They should be expressed in `snake_case` and conventionally are prefixed with the application name that the identifier is for, e.g. `myapp_user_id`, `myapp_lead_id`.

## How to Contribute

We would love for you to contribute! Anything that benefits the majority of `test_track` users—from a documentation fix to an entirely new feature—is encouraged.

Before diving in, [check our issue tracker](//github.com/Betterment/test_track/issues) and consider creating a new issue to get early feedback on your proposed change.

### Suggested Workflow

* Fork the project and create a new branch for your contribution.
* Write your contribution (and any applicable test coverage).
* Make sure all tests pass (`bundle exec rake`).
* Submit a pull request.
